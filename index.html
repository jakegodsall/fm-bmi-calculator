                    Better understand your weight in relation to your height
                    using our body mass index (BM) calculator. While BMI is not
                    the sole determinant of a healthy weight, it offers a
                    valuable starting point to evaluate your overall health and
                    well-being.

                    Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy
                    weight, it is not suited for every person. Specific groups
                    should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in certain
                    cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to use.

                            The development and body fat composition of girls
                            and boys vary with age. Consequently, a child's age
                            and gender are considered when evaluating their BMI.

                        <p>
                            In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle
                            loss may cause BMI to underestimate body fat
                            content.

                        <p>
                            BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as
                            overweight or obese, as it doesn't differentiate
                            muscle from fat.

                            Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to
                            their growing baby. Maintaining a healthy
                            pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to minimise health
                            risks for both mother and child.
