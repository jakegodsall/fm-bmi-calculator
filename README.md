# Body Mass Index Calculator Challenge

## Overview

This project is a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator, designed as part of a challenge from Frontend Mentor. It's a simple, interactive web application that allows users to calculate their BMI based on their height and weight.

### Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to practice and hone my skills in vanilla DOM manipulation using TypeScript and to exercise my CSS skills, which I am currently revitalizing. This project serves as a practical application of fundamental web development concepts and provides a hands-on experience with responsive design and user interaction.
